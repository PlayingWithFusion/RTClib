// This code is based on the JeeLab's RTC libarary for Arduino
// So why add the MCP79410? Well, it has a wider input voltage range, both
// in Vin and Vbatt (backup), as well as all of the standard functionality
// of a chip like the DS1307 with onboard NVRAM

* Originally designed for use with with Playing With Fusion MCP79410 and

* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to initialize and run an Arduino Uno R3 in
* order to communicate with the MCP74910 on the IFB-11001 RTC and uSD shield
* - Configure Arduino to broadcast results via UART
*       - call updated RTClib library to configure and read MCP79410 RTC
*       - MCP79410 is included on the IFB-11001 RTC/microSD shield
* - Set current or user-defined time
* - enable battery backup on RTC
* - Read current time from RTC
* - Calculate different times using update RTClib source functions
*  Circuit (for reference only... install full header set and place on Arduino):
*    Arduino Uno   Arduino Mega  -->  Shield / Function
*    D6            D6            -->  IFB-11001    / Card Detect - SD (not used in this example)
*    D5            D5            -->  IFB-11001    / Chip Select, SD  (not used in this example)
*    MOSI: pin 11  MOSI: pin 51  -->  IFB-11001    / SDI via ICSP     (not used in this example)
*    MISO: pin 12  MISO: pin 50  -->  IFB-11001    / SDO via ICSP     (not used in this example)
*    SCK:  pin 13  SCK:  pin 52  -->  IFB-11001    / SCLK via ICSP    (not used in this example)
*    SCL           SCL           -->  IFB-11001    / SCL  - used for RTC
*    SDA           SDA           -->  IFB-11001    / SDA  - used for RTC
*    GND           GND           -->  GND
*    5V            5V            -->  5V (supply with same voltage as Arduino I/O, 5V)
*    VCCIO         VCCIO         -->  Vcc (supply with same voltage as Arduino I/O, 3.3-5V)
*    3.3V          3.3V          --> 3.3V (this is 3.3V output from Arduino LDO)
